The UNIX operating system provides its services through a set of system calls, which are in
effect functions within the operating system that may be called by user programs. This
chapter describes how to use some of the most important system calls from C programs. If
you use UNIX, this should be directly helpful, for it is sometimes necessary to employ system
calls for maximum efficiency, or to access some facility that is not in the library. Even if you
use C on a different operating system, however, you should be able to glean insight into C
programming from studying these examples; although details vary, similar code will be found
on any system. Since the ANSI C library is in many cases modeled on UNIX facilities, this
code may help your understanding of the library as well.
